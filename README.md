## Use Case
Given an audio file audio.mp3, in which you want to transcribe the narration, a subtitle file timeline.ass with only timeline edited in Aegisub, and an account to access [IBM Speech-To-Text API service](http://www.ibm.com/smarterplanet/us/en/ibmwatson/developercloud/speech-to-text.html), this piece of code can help you go through painful transcription process (you still have to cut the timeline by yourself though).

## How to use
I'll show you later.
